# GABi Project
The GABi System (which stands for Gest√£o Aberta de Bibliotecas, i.e., Open Library Manager in Portuguese) is an old project of mine developed throughout my graduation at ULBRA through different minor courses exercises.
It's goal is to provide a product that simplifies the main operations for librarians in brazilian public schools, which don't have a proper librarian - when it does, they often work at the library just to maintaing basic services.
As improved features, it should also let students to write synopsis (as well as to like the wirtings of others), which are moderate by their teachers, as well as let teachers recommend books to students and any user to reserve them.

To be written in PHP, HTML5 and PostgreSQL, the complete project, with the use-case diagrams and the the entity relationship diagram, can be accessed in [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jcq5R45a05Knx3yUAlnnLE_sz8R9ydcO2wfV298ygs/edit?usp=sharing); the list of classes, their roles, attributes and methods can be viewed in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11MkyRNJU09lwg-rFNJbaNPWS_5NRWJLmVUf09u3teWE/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
